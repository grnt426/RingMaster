RingMaster
==========

Another game developed in under 24hours for the CSH Game Jam!

Overview
--------
A Player card is in the center Ring of 7 Action Card Slots.  Players may place
Action Cards into any Action Card Slot not currently in use by another Action
Card. At the end of each turn, the Ring rotates all Cards clockwise by the
number on the Rotation Number Card, which sits to the right of the Ring.
Passive Effect Cards may be placed in the singular Passive Effect Card slot
left of the Ring. Each player must strategically place Cards on the Ring and
control the Rotation Rate of their Ring and the Enemy's Ring. The goal is to
reduce the Enemy Player's Player Card to 0 health points; before they do!
